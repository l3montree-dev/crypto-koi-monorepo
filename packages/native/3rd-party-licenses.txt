The following NPM package may be included in this product:

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `@walletconnect/react-native-dapp`

A drop-in library which helps easily connect your [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) dapps to [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) Wallets on [**Android**](https://reactnative.dev), [**iOS**](https://reactnative.dev) and the [**Web**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

> **Notice:** This library assumes you have already enabled prerequisite support for [**Web3**](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js) inside your application. This can be done by creating a new project using [`npx create-react-native-dapp`](https://github.com/cawfree/create-react-native-dapp), or by introducing support for Web3 in an existing project by using [`npx rn-nodeify --install --hack`](https://github.com/tradle/rn-nodeify).

For more details, check out the [documentation](https://docs.walletconnect.org).

## Installing

To get started, install `@walletconnect/react-native-dapp`:

```sh
yarn add @walletconnect/react-native-dapp
```

If you haven't already, you may also need to install [`react-native-svg`](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg) alongside a persistent storage provider such as [`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage):

```sh
yarn add react-native-svg @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## Architecture

This library is implemented using the [**React Context API**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), which is used to help make an instance of a [`connector`](https://docs.walletconnect.org/client-api) accessible globally throughout your application. This permits you to use a uniform instance within even deeply nested components, and ensures your rendered application is always synchronized against the connector state.

### `WalletConnectProvider`

At the root of your application, you can declare a [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx) which controls access and persistence to a [**connector**](https://docs.walletconnect.org/client-api) instance:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import WalletConnectProvider from '@walletconnect/react-native-dapp';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

export default function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <WalletConnectProvider
      redirectUrl={Platform.OS === 'web' ? window.location.origin : 'yourappscheme://'}
      storageOptions= {{
        asyncStorage AsyncStorage,
      }}>
      <>{/* awesome app here */}</>
    </WalletConnectProvider>
  );
}
```

Above, we pass the [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx) two required parameters; `redirectUrl` and `storageOptions`:

  - The `redirectUrl` is used to help control navigation between external wallets and your application. On the `web`, you only need to specify a valid application route; whereas on mobile platforms, you must [**specify a deep link URI scheme**](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/linking/#universaldeep-links-without-a-custom-scheme).
  - The `storageOptions` prop allows you to specify the storage engine which must be used to persist session data.
    - Although in our examples we use [`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage), this can be which engine you please, provided it conforms to the [`IAsyncStorage`](https://github.com/pedrouid/keyvaluestorage) generic storage interface declaration.

Notably, the [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx) optionally accepts `WalletConnect` configuration arguments as defined by the [`IWalletConnectOptions`](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/tree/next/packages/helpers/utils) interface:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import WalletConnectProvider from '@walletconnect/react-native-dapp';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

export default function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <WalletConnectProvider
      bridge="https://bridge.walletconnect.org"
      clientMeta={{
        description: 'Connect with WalletConnect',
        url: 'https://walletconnect.org',
        icons: ['https://walletconnect.org/walletconnect-logo.png'],
        name: 'WalletConnect',
      }}
      redirectUrl={Platform.OS === 'web' ? window.location.origin : 'yourappscheme://'}
      storageOptions= {{
        asyncStorage AsyncStorage,
      }}>
      <>{/* awesome app here */}</>
    </WalletConnectProvider>
  );
}
```

In the snippet above, aside from the required props, we can see the default configuration of the [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx).

> **Tip:** Your custom options are merged _deeply_ against this default configuration. Therefore it's possible to override individual nested properties without being required to define _all_ of them.

#### `withWalletConnect`
Alternatively to manually using the [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx), you can use the [`withWalletConnect`](./src/hooks/useWalletConnect.ts) higher order component which will wrap your root application in a [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx) for you:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { withWalletConnect, useWalletConnect } from '@walletconnect/react-native-dapp';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const connector = useWalletConnect(); // valid
  return <>{/* awesome app here */}</>;
}

export default withWalletConnect(App, {
  clientMeta: {
    description: 'Connect with WalletConnect',
  },
  redirectUrl: Platform.OS === 'web' ? window.location.origin : 'yourappscheme://',
  storageOptions: {
    asyncStorage: AsyncStorage,
  },
});
```

This is almost identical in functionality to the manual implementation of a [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx), with the key difference that we're able to make a call to [`useWalletConnect`](./src/hooks/useWalletConnect.ts) directly from the `App` component. By contrast, in the previous example only child components of the [`WalletConnectProvider`](./src/providers/WalletConnectProvider.tsx) may be able to invoke this hook.

### `useWalletConnect`

The [`useWalletConnect`](./src/hooks/useWalletConnect.ts) hook provides access to a [`WalletConnect`](https://docs.walletconnect.org/client-api) `connector` instance which is accessible on Android, iOS and the Web. This conforms to the original specification:

```typescript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { useWalletConnect, withWalletConnect } from '@walletconnect/react-native-dapp';
import * as React from 'react';

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const connector = useWalletConnect();
  if (!connector.connected) {
    /**
     *  Connect! üéâ
     */
    return <Button title="Connect" onPress={() => connector.connect())} />;
  }
  return <Button title="Kill Session" onPress={() => connector.killSession()} />;
}

export default withWalletConnect(App, {
  redirectUrl: Platform.OS === 'web' ? window.location.origin : 'yourappscheme://',
  storageOptions: {
    asyncStorage AsyncStorage,
  },
});
```

## Customization
`@walletconnect/react-native-dapp` also permits you to customize the presentation of the [`QrcodeModal`](./src/components/QrcodeModal.tsx). This is achieved by passing the [**Render Callback**]() prop, `renderQrcodeModal`, to our calls to `withWalletConnect` or instances of `WalletConnectProvider`.

For example, you could choose to render a wallet selection using a `BottomSheet` opposed to a `Modal`:

```typescript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import BottomSheet from 'react-native-reanimated-bottom-sheet';
import { Image, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import {
  useWalletConnect,
  withWalletConnect,
  RenderQrcodeModalProps,
  WalletService,
} from '@walletconnect/react-native-dapp';
import * as React from 'react';

function CustomBottomSheet({
  walletServices,
  visible,
  connectToWalletService,
  uri,
}: RenderQrcodeModalProps): JSX.Element {
  const renderContent = React.useCallback(() => {
    return walletServices.map((walletService: WalletService, i: number) => (
      <TouchableOpacity key={`i${i}`} onPress={() => connectToWalletService(walletService, uri)}>
        <Image source={{ uri: walletService.logo }} />
        <Text>{walletService.name}</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    ));
  }, [walletServices, uri]);
  return <BottomSheet renderContent={renderContent} {...etc} />;
};

function App(): JSX.Element {
  const connector = useWalletConnect();
  return <>{/* awesome custom app here */}</>;
}

export default withWalletConnect(App, {
  redirectUrl: Platform.OS === 'web' ? window.location.origin : 'yourappscheme://',
  storageOptions: {
    asyncStorage AsyncStorage,
  },
  renderQrcodeModal: (props: RenderQrcodeModalProps): JSX.Element => (
    <CustomBottomSheet {...props} />
  ),
});

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @walletconnect/web3-provider@1.7.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# WalletConnect Web3 Provider

Web3 Provider for WalletConnect

For more details, read the [documentation](https://docs.walletconnect.org)

## Setup

```typescript
import Web3 from "web3";
import WalletConnectProvider from "@walletconnect/web3-provider";

//  Create WalletConnect Provider
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: "27e484dcd9e3efcfd25a83a78777cdf1", // Required
});

//  Enable session (triggers QR Code modal)
await provider.enable();

//  Create Web3
const web3 = new Web3(provider);
```

## Events (EIP-1193)

```typescript
// Subscribe to accounts change
provider.on("accountsChanged", (accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log(accounts);
});

// Subscribe to chainId change
provider.on("chainChanged", (chainId: number) => {
  console.log(chainId);
});

// Subscribe to session connection
provider.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("connect");
});

// Subscribe to session disconnection
provider.on("disconnect", (code: number, reason: string) => {
  console.log(code, reason);
});
```

## Provider Methods

```typescript
interface RequestArguments {
  method: string;
  params?: unknown[] | object;
}

// Send JSON RPC requests
const result = await provider.request(payload: RequestArguments);

// Close provider session
await provider.disconnect()
```

## Web3 Methods

```typescript
//  Get Accounts
const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

//  Get Chain Id
const chainId = await web3.eth.chainId();

//  Get Network Id
const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId();

// Send Transaction
const txHash = await web3.eth.sendTransaction(tx);

// Sign Transaction
const signedTx = await web3.eth.signTransaction(tx);

// Sign Message
const signedMessage = await web3.eth.sign(msg);

// Sign Typed Data
const signedTypedData = await web3.eth.signTypedData(msg);
```

## Provider Options

### Required

In order to resolve non-signing requests you need to provide one of the following:

#### Infura ID

The infuraId will support the following chainId's: Mainnet (1), Ropsten (3), Rinkeby(4), Goerli (5) and Kovan (42)

```typescript
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: "27e484dcd9e3efcfd25a83a78777cdf1",
});
```

#### RPC URL Mapping

The RPC URL mapping should indexed by chainId and it requires at least one value.

```typescript
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  rpc: {
    1: "https://mainnet.mycustomnode.com",
    3: "https://ropsten.mycustomnode.com",
    100: "https://dai.poa.network",
    // ...
  },
});
```

### Optional

You can also customize the connector through the provider using the following options

#### Bridge URL

Use your own hosted bridge by providing the url

```typescript
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: "27e484dcd9e3efcfd25a83a78777cdf1",
  bridge: "https://bridge.myhostedserver.com",
});
```

#### Disable QR Code Modal

Use your own custom qrcode modal and disable the built-in one

```typescript
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: "27e484dcd9e3efcfd25a83a78777cdf1",
  qrcode: false,
});

provider.connector.on("display_uri", (err, payload) => {
  const uri = payload.params[0];
  CustomQRCodeModal.display(uri);
});
```

#### Filter Linking Options

If you would like to reduce the number of linking options or customize its order, you can provide an array of wallet names.
Providing empty whitelist disables linking.

```typescript
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: "27e484dcd9e3efcfd25a83a78777cdf1",
  qrcodeModalOptions: {
    mobileLinks: [
      "rainbow",
      "metamask",
      "argent",
      "trust",
      "imtoken",
      "pillar",
    ],
    desktopLinks: [
      "encrypted ink",
    ]
  }
});
```

## Installation

```bash
yarn add ansi-fragments
```

## Usage

```js
import { color, modifier, pad, container } from 'ansi-fragments';

const prettyLog = (level, message) => container(
  color('green', modifier('italic', level)),
  pad(1),
  message
).build();

console.log(prettyLog('success', 'Yay!'));
```

## API

Each fragment implements `IFragment` interface:

```ts
interface IFragment {
  build(): string;
}
```

The `build` method is responsible for traversing the tree of fragments and create a string representation with ANSI escape codes.


#### `color`

```ts
color(
  ansiColor: AnsiColor,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [colors](./src/fragments/Color.ts).

```js
color('red', 'Oh no');
color('bgBlue', color('brightBlue', 'Hey'));
color('green', modifier('bold', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `modifier`

```ts
modifier(
  ansiModifier: AnsiModifier,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [modifiers](./src/fragments/Modifier.ts): `dim`, `bold`, `hidden`, `italic`, `underline`, `strikethrough`.

```js
modifier('underline', 'Hello', 'World');
modifier('italic', modifier('bold', 'Hey'));
modifier('bold', color('green', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `container`

```ts
container(...children: Array<string | IFragment>): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which sole purpose is to hold and build nested fragments.

```js
container(
  color('gray', '[08/01/18 12:00]'),
  pad(1),
  color('green', 'success'),
  pad(1),
  'Some message'
)
```

#### `pad`

```ts
pad(count: number, separator?: string): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which repeats given separator (default: ` `) given number of times.

```js
pad(1);
pad(2, '#')
pad(1, '\n')
```

#### `fixed`

```ts
fixed(
  value: number,
  bias: 'start' | 'end',
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which makes sure the children will always build to given number of non-ANSI characters. It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.

```js
fixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'
fixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '
fixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'
```

#### `ifElse`

```ts
ifElse(
  condition: Condition,
  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,
  elseFragment: string | IFragment
): IFragment

type ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;
type Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);
```

Change the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.

```js
let condition = getConditionValue()
ifElse(
  () => condition,
  color('red', 'ERROR'),
  color('yellow', 'WARNING')
)
```

#### `provide`

```ts
provide<T>(
  value: T,
  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment
): IFragment
```

Provides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.

```js
provide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {
  switch (value.level) {
    case 'error':
      return container(
        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    case 'info':
      return container(
        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    default:
      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);
  }
})
```

[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/codingjerk/appdirsjs)](https://codecov.io/gh/codingjerk/appdirsjs)

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/codingjerk/appdirsjs)](https://github.com/codingjerk/appdirsjs/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

A node.js library to get paths to directories to store configs, caches and data according to OS standarts.

## Installation

```sh
npm install appdirsjs
```

or

```sh
yarn install appdirsjs
```

if you're using yarn.

## Usage

```javascript
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({ appName: "expo" });

console.log(dirs.cache);
// /home/user/.cache/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Caches/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\expo on Windows

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.config/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Preferences/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\expo

console.log(dirs.data);
// /home/user/.local/share/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Application Support/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\expo
```

### Keep backward compability

Then switching from old-style dotfile directory,
such as `~/.myapp` to new, like `~/.config/myapp`,
you can pass `legacyPath` parameter
to keep using old directory if it exists:

```javascript
import * as path from "path";
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({
  appName: "expo",
  // Notice usage of full path
  legacyPath: path.join(os.homedir(), ".expo"),
});

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.expo
```

## TODO

- [ ] Android support
- [ ] XDG on BSD support

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - async-eventemitter@0.2.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# AsyncEventEmitter

> An EventEmitter that supports serial execution of asynchronous event listeners.
> It also supports event listeners without callbacks (synchronous), as well as
> interrupting the call-chain (similar to the DOM's e.stopPropagation()).


## Example

```javascript
var AsyncEventEmitter = require('async-eventemitter');
var events = new AsyncEventEmitter();

events.on('test', function (e, next) {
  // The next event listener will wait til this is done
  setTimeout(next, 1000);
});

events
  .on('test', function (e) {
    // This is a synchronous event listener (note the lack of a second
    // callback argument)
    console.log(e);
    // { data: 'data' }
  })
  .on('test', function (e, next) {
    // Even if you're not truly asynchronous you can use next() to stop propagation
    next(new Error('You shall not pass'));
  });

events.emit('test', { data: 'data' }, function (err) {
  // This is run after all of the event listeners are done
  console.log(err);
  // [Error: You shall not pass]
});
```

More examples are found in the `test`-folder.


## Important differences between AsyncEventEmitter the native EventEmitter

The API and behavior of AsyncEventEmitter is as far as possible and meaningful
identical to that of the native EventEmitter. However there are some important
differences which should be noted.

* Data sent to event listeners (`eg emit(data)`) must always be **zero** or
  **one** argument, and can *not* be a function.
* Event listeners will always recieve the data object, which may or may not be
  undefined.
* The second argument can only be a callback, and will only be supplied if
  the event listener has an arity of two or more (eg `function(e, next){}`).
* Event listeners with an arity of one or zero (eg without a callback argument
  specified) will be treated as synchronous.
* Even if all event listeners are synchronous, they will still be executed
  asynchronously (through setImmediate) and thus code suceeding `.emit()` will
  be executed before any event listeners.
* Interupt the callback chain in async listeners by calling the callback with
  the error as the first parameter; in sync listeners by throwing an Error.


## Usage

### Unchanged

For `addListener() on() once() removeListener() removeAllListeners()
setMaxListeners() listeners()` see the [EventEmitter docs](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html),
nothing new here.


### `emit(event, [data], [callback])`

Executes all listeners for the event in order with the supplied data argument.
The optional callback is called when all of the listeners are done.

### `.first(event, new)`

Adds a listener to the beginning of the listeners array for the specified event.

### `.at(event, index, listener)`

Adds a listener at the specified index in the listeners array for the specified
event.

### `.before(event, target, listener)`

Adds a listener before the target listener in the listeners array for the
specified event.

### `.after(event, target, listener)`

Adds a listener after the target listener in the listeners array for the
specified event.

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-core@7.0.0-bridge.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## babel-bridge

This repo holds what we're calling a "bridge" package that is meant to ease the
transition for libraries that use "babel-core" as a peer dependency for Babel 6.

The issue with Babel 7's transition to scopes is that if a package depends on
Babel 6, they may want to add support for Babel 7 alongside. Because Babel 7
will be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have
no way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.

```js
peerDependencies: {
  "babel-core": "6.x"
}
```
cannot change to

```js
peerDependencies: {
  "@babel/core": "6.x"
}
```

without it being a breaking change.

### Solution

To address this, we're releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do


```js
peerDependencies: {
  "babel-core": "6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge"
}
```

then where users of this package would originally have done

```sh
npm i some-package babel-core
```

to install Babel 6, they could now do


```sh
npm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core
```

to install the bridge package, and install Babel 7's core.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-react-native-web@0.17.5

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-react-native-web

[![npm version][package-badge]][package-url] [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)

A Babel plugin that will alias `react-native` to `react-native-web` and exclude
any modules not required by your app (keeping bundle size down).

## Installation

```
yarn add --dev babel-plugin-react-native-web
```

## Usage

**.babelrc**

```
{
  "plugins": [
    ["react-native-web", { commonjs: true }]
  ]
}
```

You should configure the plugin to match the module format used by your
bundler. Most modern bundlers will use a package's ES modules by default (i.e.,
if `package.json` has a `module` field). But if you need the plugin to rewrite
import paths to point to CommonJS modules, you must set the `commonjs` option
to `true`.

## Example

NOTE: `react-native-web` internal paths are _not stable_ and you must not rely
on them. Always use the Babel plugin to optimize your build. What follows is an
example of the rewrite performed by the plugin.

**Before**

```js
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
```

**After**

```js
import StyleSheet from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/StyleSheet';
import View from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/View';
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas@7.0.0-beta.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas

> Compile trailing function commas to ES5


```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```

## Example

### Basic
This is an example from the [Proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas).

Let's say you have this function:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar'
);
```

If you want to have a new parameter called `param3`, the diff output would be like that:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
- param2
+ param2, // Change this line to add a comma
+ param3  // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
- 'bar'
+ 'bar', // Change this line to add a comma
+ 'baz'  // Add param3
);
```
In total, you have to change 2 lines for the function declaration and 2 lines for each usage.

If you had your function defined with trailing commas:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```
Adding a new parameter would only change one line in the function declaration and one line for each usage:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
+ param3, // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
+ 'baz', // Add param3
);
```
In the end, your diff output will be cleaner and easier to read, it would be much quicker to add a new parameter to your functions, it also makes it easier to copy paste elements and move code around.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["syntax-trailing-function-commas"]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins syntax-trailing-function-commas script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["syntax-trailing-function-commas"]
});
```

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-preset-expo@9.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-preset-expo

This preset extends the default React Native preset (`metro-react-native-babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed.

You can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for `metro-react-native-babel-preset`. If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.

If you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `expo start:web` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.

If you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports
at https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!

## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance

A bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.

### Babel Loader

The babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.

#### platform

A `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.

| Value     | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |
| `android` | Runs on Android devices |
| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |

#### bundler

A `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.
If the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.

| Value     | Description                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |
| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |

[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/
[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/

## Options

### [`jsxRuntime`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)

`classic | automatic`, defaults to `automatic`

- `automatic` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to `import React from 'react'` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings.
- `classic` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.

```js
[
  'babel-preset-expo',
  {
    jsxRuntime: 'classic',
  },
];
```

This property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when `native.useTransformReactJSXExperimental` is set to `true` because `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is omitted.

### [`jsxImportSource`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)

`string`, defaults to `react`

This option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions. 

```js
[
  'babel-preset-expo',
  {
    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
    jsxImportSource: 'react',
  },
];
```

This property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when `jsxRuntime` is not set to `automatic`.

### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)

Changes Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.

_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.

This can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.

The value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:

- `null` - [metro-react-native-babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tree/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)

- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.

- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).

- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.

**default:** `null`

```js
[
    'babel-preset-expo',
    {
        lazyImports: true
    }
],
```

### `web.disableImportExportTransform`

Enabling this option will allow your project to run with older JavaScript syntax (i.e. `module.exports`). This option will break tree shaking and increase your bundle size, but will eliminate the following error when `module.exports` is used:

> `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`

**default:** `false`

```js
[
    'babel-preset-expo',
    {
        web: { disableImportExportTransform: true }
    }
],
```

Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - bn.js@4.11.8

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

This package contains the following license and notice below:

bs58
====

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/cryptocoinjs/bs58.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cryptocoinjs/bs58)

JavaScript component to compute base 58 encoding. This encoding is typically used for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.

**Note:** If you're looking for **base 58 check** encoding, see: [https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bs58check](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bs58check), which depends upon this library.


Install
-------

    npm i --save bs58


API
---

### encode(input)

`input` must be a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) or an `Array`. It returns a `string`.

**example**:

```js
const bs58 = require('bs58')

const bytes = Buffer.from('003c176e659bea0f29a3e9bf7880c112b1b31b4dc826268187', 'hex')
const address = bs58.encode(bytes)
console.log(address)
// => 16UjcYNBG9GTK4uq2f7yYEbuifqCzoLMGS
```


### decode(input)

`input` must be a base 58 encoded string. Returns a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html).

**example**:

```js
const bs58 = require('bs58')

const address = '16UjcYNBG9GTK4uq2f7yYEbuifqCzoLMGS'
const bytes = bs58.decode(address)
console.log(out.toString('hex'))
// => 003c176e659bea0f29a3e9bf7880c112b1b31b4dc826268187
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - bser@2.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# BSER Binary Serialization

BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.

It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.

For more details about the serialization scheme see
[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).

## API

```js
var bser = require('bser');
```

### bser.loadFromBuffer

The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,
decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the
input is invalid.

```js
var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);
```

### bser.dumpToBuffer

Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.

```js
var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);
console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']
```

### BunserBuf

The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.
You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the
decoded values via its `value` event.

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log(obj);
});
```

Then in your socket `data` event:

```js
bunser.append(buf);
```

## Example

Read BSER from socket:

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log('data from socket', obj);
});

var socket = net.connect('/socket');

socket.on('data', function(buf) {
  bunser.append(buf);
});
```

Write BSER to socket:

```js
socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - buffer-alloc-unsafe@1.1.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Buffer Alloc Unsafe

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.allocUnsafe`.

Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc-unsafe
```

## Usage

```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>

allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```

## API

### allocUnsafe(size)

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

# Buffer Alloc

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.alloc`.

Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc
```

## Usage

```js
const alloc = require('buffer-alloc')

console.log(alloc(4))
//=> <Buffer 00 00 00 00>

console.log(alloc(6, 0x41))
//=> <Buffer 41 41 41 41 41 41>

console.log(alloc(10, 'linus', 'utf8'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73 6c 69 6e 75 73>
```

## API

### alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
- `fill` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; A value to pre-fill the new `Buffer` with. **Default:** `0`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `fill` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `fill` is `undefined`, the `Buffer` will be zero-filled.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - buffer-fill@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

console.log(buf.fill(9, 2, 4))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 09 09 08>

console.log(buf.fill('linus', 'latin1'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - capture-exit@2.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# capture-exit

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8044m918rwic8b9n/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/embercli/capture-exit/branch/master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/capture-exit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/capture-exit)

Allow cooprative async exit handlers, we unfortunately must hijack
process.exit.

It allows a handler to ensure exit, without that exit handler impeding other
similar handlers

for example, see: [sindresorhus/ora#27](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/27)

Differences between `process.on('exit')` and `captureExit.onExit(...)` => https://github.com/ember-cli/capture-exit/issues/12


### Installation

```sh
yarn add capture-exit
// or
npm install --save capture-exit
```

### Usage

```js
// as early in startup as possible
require('capture-exit').captureExit();

// when you want to schedule some work on exit:
function onExit() {
  return something.processWillExit(); // you can return promises, which will pause exit until fulfilled
}

require('capture-exit').onExit(onExit); // add an exit handler
require('capture-exit').offExit(onExit); // allows one to remove an exit handle if it is not longer required
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - denodeify@1.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

denodeify [ ![Codeship Status for matthew-andrews/denodeify](https://codeship.io/projects/02ac77d0-1a58-0132-bf86-4a07366ee29d/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/34622)
=========

Tool to turn functions with Node-style callback APIs into functions that return [Promises](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

Inspired by and adapted from Q's [`Q.denodeify`/`Q.nfcall` function](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qnfbindnodefunc-args).

Warning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.

If you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-
- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`
- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`
- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`
- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`

Note: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. 

## Installation

```
npm install denodeify --save
```

Or:-

```
bower install denodeify --save
```

## Examples

Simple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);

readFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })
  .then(function(text) {
    console.log("My file's contents is: " + text);
  });
```

(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)

More complex example with `exec`:-

## Advanced usage

You can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {

  // Throw away stderr data
  return [err, stdout];
});

exec('hostname')
  .then(function(host) {
    console.log("My hostname is: " + host.replace('\n', ''));
  });
```

Or,

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {
  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];
});

exec('my-command')
  .then(function(results) {
    console.log("stdout is: " + results[0]);
    console.log("stderr is: " + results[1]);
  });
```

Useful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

## Credits and collaboration ##

The lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesi≈Ñski](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - dlv@1.1.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)

> Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined


### Why?

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**

You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].

Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.


### Installation

`npm install --save dlv`


### Usage

`delve(object, keypath, [default])`

```js
import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

//undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';
```


### Setter Counterparts

- [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
- [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## Benchmarks

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

# node-errno

<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// ‚Üí {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// ‚Üí {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

# Eth-Sig-Util [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/MetaMask/eth-sig-util.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/MetaMask/eth-sig-util)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/MetaMask/eth-sig-util.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A small collection of ethereum signing functions.

You can find usage examples [here](https://github.com/flyswatter/js-eth-personal-sign-examples) 

[Available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-sig-util)

## Supported Signing Methods

Currently there is only one supported signing protocol. More will be added as standardized. 

- Personal Sign (`personal_sign`) [geth thread](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2940)


## Installation

```
npm install eth-sig-util --save
```

## Methods

### concatSig(v, r, s)

All three arguments should be provided as buffers.

Returns a continuous, hex-prefixed hex value for the signature, suitable for inclusion in a JSON transaction's data field.

### normalize(address)

Takes an address of either upper or lower case, with or without a hex prefix, and returns an all-lowercase, hex-prefixed address, suitable for submitting to an ethereum provider.

### personalSign (privateKeyBuffer, msgParams)

msgParams should have a `data` key that is hex-encoded data to sign.

Returns the prefixed signature expected for calls to `eth.personalSign`.

### recoverPersonalSignature (msgParams)

msgParams should have a `data` key that is hex-encoded data unsigned, and a `sig` key that is hex-encoded and already signed.

Returns a hex-encoded sender address.

### signTypedData (privateKeyBuffer, msgParams)

Signs typed data as per [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712).

Data should be under `data` key of `msgParams`. The method returns prefixed signature.

### recoverTypedSignature ({data, sig})

Return address of a signer that did `signTypedData`.

Expects the same data that were used for signing. `sig` is a prefixed signature.

### typedSignatureHash (typedData)

Return hex-encoded hash of typed data params according to [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712) schema.

### extractPublicKey (msgParams)

msgParams should have a `data` key that is hex-encoded data unsigned, and a `sig` key that is hex-encoded and already signed.

Returns a hex-encoded public key.

 - ethereumjs-account@2.0.5

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# SYNOPSIS

[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ethereumjs-account.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ethereumjs-account)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-account.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-account)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-account.svg?style=flat-square)](https://coveralls.io/r/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-account)

[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

This library eases the handling of Ethereum accounts, where accounts can be either external accounts 
or contracts (see 
[Account Types](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/account-types-gas-and-transactions.html) docs).

Note that the library is not meant to be used to handle your wallet accounts, use e.g. the
[web3-eth-personal](http://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-personal.html) package from the 
``web3.js`` library for that. This is just a semantic wrapper to ease the use of account data and
provide functionality for reading and writing accounts from and to the Ethereum state trie.

# INSTALL
`npm install ethereumjs-account`

# BROWSER
This module work with `browserify`.

# API
 - [`new Account([data])`](#new-accountdata)
  - [`Account` Properties](#account-properties)
  - [`Account` Methods](#account-methods)
    - [`account.isEmpty()`](#accountisempty)
    - [`account.isContract()`](#accountiscontract)
    - [`account.serialize()`](#accountserialize)
    - [`account.toJSON()`](#accounttojson)
    - [`account.getCode(trie, cb)`](#accountgetcodetrie-cb)
    - [`account.setCode(trie, code, cb)`](#accountsetcodetrie-code-cb)
    - [`account.getStorage(trie, key, cb)`](#accountgetstoragetrie-key-cb)
    - [`account.setStorage(trie, key, val, cb)`](#accountsetstoragetrie-key-val-cb)

### `new Account([data])`
Creates a new account object
- `data` - an account can be initialized with either a `buffer` containing the RLP serialized account.
 Or an `Array` of buffers relating to each of the account Properties, listed in order below.  For example:
```javascript
var raw = [ 
  '0x02', //nonce
  '0x0384', //balance
  '0x56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421', //stateRoot
  '0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470'  //codeHash
  ];

var account = new Account(raw);
```

Or lastly an `Object` containing the Properties of the account:

```javascript
var raw = {
  nonce: '',
  balance: '0x03e7',
  stateRoot: '0x56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421',
  codeHash: '0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470'
};

var account = new Account(raw);
```
For `Object` and `Array` each of the elements can either be a `Buffer`, hex `String`, `Number`, or an object with a `toBuffer` method such as `Bignum`.

### `Account` Properties
- `nonce` - The account's nonce.
- `balance`  - The account's balance in wei.
- `stateRoot` - The stateRoot for the storage of the contract.
- `codeHash` - The hash of the code of the contract.

### `Account` Methods

#### `account.isEmpty()`
Returns a `Boolean` determining if the account is empty.

#### `account.isContract()`
Returns a `Boolean` deteremining if the account is a contract.

#### `account.serialize()`
Returns the RLP serialization of the account as a `Buffer`.

#### `account.toJSON([object])`
Returns the account as JSON.
- `object` - A `Boolean` that defaults to false. If `object` is true then this will return an `Object`, else it will return an `Array`.

#### `account.getCode(trie, cb)`
Fetches the code from the trie.
- `trie` - The [trie](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree) storing the accounts.
- `cb` - The callback.

#### `account.setCode(trie, code, cb)`
Stores the code in the trie.
- `trie` - The [trie](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree) storing the accounts.
- `code` - A `Buffer`.
- `cb` - The callback.

Example for ``getCode`` and ``setCode``:
```javascript
// Requires manual merkle-patricia-tree install
const SecureTrie = require('merkle-patricia-tree/secure')
const Account = require('./index.js')

let code = Buffer.from('73095e7baea6a6c7c4c2dfeb977efac326af552d873173095e7baea6a6c7c4c2dfeb977efac326af552d873157', 'hex')

let raw = {
  nonce: '',
  balance: '0x03e7',
  stateRoot: '0x56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421',
  codeHash: '0xb30fb32201fe0486606ad451e1a61e2ae1748343cd3d411ed992ffcc0774edd4'
}

let account = new Account(raw)
let trie = new SecureTrie()

account.setCode(trie, code, function (err, codeHash) {
  console.log(`Code with hash 0x${codeHash.toString('hex')} set to trie`)
  account.getCode(trie, function (err, code) {
    console.log(`Code ${code.toString('hex')} read from trie`)
  })
})
```

#### `account.getStorage(trie, key, cb)`
Fetches `key` from the account's storage.

#### `account.setStorage(trie, key, val, cb)`
Stores a `val` at the `key` in the contract's storage.

Example for ``getStorage`` and ``setStorage``:

```javascript
// Requires manual merkle-patricia-tree install
const SecureTrie = require('merkle-patricia-tree/secure')
const Account = require('./index.js')

let raw = {
  nonce: '',
  balance: '0x03e7',
  stateRoot: '0x56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421',
  codeHash: '0xb30fb32201fe0486606ad451e1a61e2ae1748343cd3d411ed992ffcc0774edd4'
}

let account = new Account(raw)
let trie = new SecureTrie()

let key = Buffer.from('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'hex')
let value = Buffer.from('01', 'hex')

account.setStorage(trie, key, value, function (err, value) {
  account.getStorage(trie, key, function (err, value) {
    console.log(`Value ${value.toString('hex')} set and retrieved from trie.`)
  })
})
```

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - expo-app-loading@1.3.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# expo-app-loading

A React component that tells expo-splash-screen to remain visible if it is the first and only component rendered in your app.
This can be useful while download and cache fonts, logos, icon images and other assets that you want to be sure the user has on their device for an optimal experience before rendering and they start using the app. You can alternatively use expo-splash-screen APIs directly - expo-app-loading just wraps them.

# Importing native dependencies - autolinking

Many React Native libraries come with platform-specific (native) code. This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:

### iOS

> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run `pod install` again.

```ruby
# Podfile

require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"`), "scripts/react_native_pods")
require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('react-native-unimodules/package.json')"`), "cocoapods.rb")
require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"`), "scripts/autolinking")

#  ...

target "TargetName" do
  use_unimodules!
  config = use_native_modules!
  use_react_native!(:path => config["reactNativePath"])

  # ...
end
```

### Android

```groovy
// app/build.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native-unimodules/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy")
apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../react.gradle")
apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle")

// ...

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle");
applyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project)
```

```groovy
// settings.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native-unimodules/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy");
includeUnimodulesProjects()

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle");
applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
```

### Explanation

The scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's `node_modules` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain `node_modules` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.

- On iOS, we use [`` ` ` `` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)).
- On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.

The Node process that is spawned runs [`require.resolve`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's `package.json`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the `main` attribute from the `package.json` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.

You can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.

## üöÄ Features

### Built-in splash screen image resize modes

`expo-splash-screen` contains a built-in feature for taking care of properly displaying your splash screen image. You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.

#### `CONTAIN` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

<table>
  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>
<td>

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### `COVER` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

<table>
  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### `NATIVE` resize mode

> **Android only.**

By using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.
Android (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)

Selecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.
Please take a look at the [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#resdrawablesplashscreenxml) and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#resdrawablesplashscreen_backgroundpng) sections.

### Per-appearance (a.k.a. dark-mode) splash screen

`expo-splash-screen` supports per-appearance splash screens that respond to system appearance changes on iOS 13+ and dark-mode changes on Android 10+.

### StatusBar customization

`expo-splash-screen` allows customization of the StatusBar according to the [ReactNative StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).

## üìö API

```tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
```

The native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

This method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).

Preventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).
`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Hides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.

## üóí Examples

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope

`App.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
  .then(result => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))
  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error

export default class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Hides native splash screen after 2s
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }, 2000);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! üëã</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`

`App.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    appIsReady: false,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding
    try {
      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(e);
    }
    this.prepareResources();
  }

  /**
   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls
   */
  prepareResources = async () => {
    await performAPICalls(...);
    await downloadAssets(...);

    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! üëã</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

## üíª Installation in managed Expo projects

Refer to [the SplashScreen section of the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/).

## üñ• Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

## Add the package to your dependencies

```
expo install expo-splash-screen
```

## üì± Configure iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the package.

### Automatic configuration

The easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/master/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.

### Manual Configuration

To achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.

The guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use a single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).

1. [Add an image to `Images.xcassets`](#-add-an-image-to-imagesxcassets)
2. [Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-create-splashscreenstoryboard)
3. [Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-select-content-mode-for-the-imageview-in-splashscreenstoryboard)
4. [Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen](#-mark-splashscreenstoryboard-as-the-launchscreen)
5. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode)
6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar)

#### üõ† Add an image to `Images.xcassets`

First you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.

1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.
2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.
3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### üõ† Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.

1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.
2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:
   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
   - find `View Controller` element,
   - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png" height="350" />
</details>

3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:
   - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,
   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
   - find `Image View` element,
   - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png" height="350" />
</details>

4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:
   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,
   - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png" height="350" />
</details>

5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:
   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png" height="350" />
</details>

6. Configure `Image View` source:
   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png" height="350" />
</details>

7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:
   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - configure `Background` parameter:
     - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### üõ† Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is how your image will be displayed on the screen.

1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.
2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.
3. Select one of the following:
   - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),
   - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).
4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### üõ† Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen

The newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.

1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`
2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.
3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.
4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.

</details>

#### üõ† (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode

##### Provide different background colors

Depending on what iOS version your application is targeting, you have to adjust your native project differently to a obtain working per-appearance splash screen view.

##### I'm targeting iOS 11+

You can take advantage of [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) in your Xcode project.

1. Create a new `Color Set` and customize its values for different color modes:
   - in your `.xcassets` directory (either create a new `.xcassets` for colors, or reuse an existing one e.g. with images) create `New Color Set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and change `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,
   - select desired color in `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel for each mode.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-createNamedColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

2. Select created `named color` as the `Background` for the `Image View` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`:
   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - configure `Background` parameter by selecting your created `named color` (that should be listed as `SplashScreenBackground`).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectNamedColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

##### I'm targeting iOS version < 11

You cannot use [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) feature in your Xcode project.
Instead you have to create an additional image set that contains small 1x1px images, each with the desired background color. Then, you'll use this additional image resource as a background in the splash screen view.

You can use this online generator to obtain 1x1px `.png` images with desired colors: http://www.1x1px.me.

1. Create `SplashScreenBackground` `Image Set` with desired background colors for each mode in your `Images.xcassets` directory:
   - open your `.xcassets` directory with images,
   - in the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,
   - convert this `Image set` to support `Dark Appearance` by navigating to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and changing `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,
   - provide images with colors for every mode (you can generate color 1x1px images using http://www.1x1px.me).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addSplashScreenBackgroundImages.png" height="250" />
</details>

2. Update `SplashScreen.storyboard` to consist of a single top-level `View` with two `Image View` subviews (solid-colored image in the background and actual splash screen image in the foreground):

   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and replace `Image View` with a plain `View` (search `Library` for it and drag&drop it in place of current `Image View`),
   - add two

3. Configure first `Image View` (background color):
   - configure attributes in `Attributes Inspector`:
     - set `Image` to `SplashScreenBackground` (prepared in previous step),
     - set `Content Mode` to `Scale To Fill` (color needs to take all available space),
   - make this subview take all available space in parent view:
     - open `Add new constraints` bottom menu,
     - make sure `Constrain to margin` is not checked,
     - for every input, open the dropdown and select `View` (parent view reference) and set `0` as the value,
     - once every side is covered (`0` value and parent view reference selected in dropdown) hit `Add 4 Constraints`,
     - observe that in `View Hierarchy Inspector` constraints are added and `Image View` resized to take whole place of parent view.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-createBackgroundImageView.png" height="350" />
</details>

4. Configure second `Image View` (actual splash screen image):
   - select second `Image View` and select correct `Image` in `Attributes Inspector` alongside with desired `Content Mode`,
   - make this subview take all available space in parent view (see previous step).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addConstraintsToImageViews.png" height="350" />
</details>

##### Provide different splash screen image

You might want to add a separate image for `dark` mode. If the system is switched to `dark` mode, it would pick this different image instead of the normal one and present it in the splash screen view.

1. In your Xcode project open `SplashScreen` (created in previous section).
2. Convert this asset to support `Dark Appearance`:

- navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
- locate `Appearances` section and select `Any, Dark`,
- provide image for `dark mode` by dropping it to the correct box.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addDarkImagesXcassets.png" height="280" />
</details>

###### Background color when you want to support iOS < 11

If you're targeting a version of iOS < 11 then you cannot use `named color` feature and instead you need to generate images with desired background colors that are going to be used as the background for splash screen view.
There is this awesome 1x1px png online generator: http://www.1x1px.me (use it to generate two 1x1px images with desired background colors for different color modes).

#### üõ† (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar

You might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.

1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag:

- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,
- add or modify `Status bar initially hidden` attribute with desired value.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-hidden.png" height="350" />
</details>

2. Customize `StatusBar style` option:

- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,
- add or modify `Status bar style` attribute with desired value.

## ü§ñ Configure Android

To achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.

### Automatic configuration

The easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/master/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.

### Manual Configuration

1. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreen_imagepng)
2. [Configure `res/values/colors.xml`](#-configure-resvaluescolorsxml)
3. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreenxml)
4. [Configure `res/values/styles.xml`](#-configure-resvaluesstylesxml)
5. [Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`](#-configure-androidmanifestxml)
6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customzine `resizeMode`](#-optional-customize-resizemode)
7. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode-1)
8. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar-1)

#### üõ† Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`

You have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.
This image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.

##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've overridden `<string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you need to do a few additional steps.

In your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).

To achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:

- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)
- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).
- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).

Each of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).

#### üõ† Configure `res/values/colors.xml`

This file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.
Update the file with the following content or create one if missing:

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->
</resources>
```

#### üõ† Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`

This file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.
Create the file with the following content:

```diff
+ <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
+   <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ </layer-list>
```

#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've overridden `<string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you shoulw add:

```diff
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ <item>
+   <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/splashscreen_image"/>
+ </item>
</layer-list>
```

#### üõ† Configure `res/values/styles.xml`

Locate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.

```diff
  <!-- Main activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
+   <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

#### üõ† Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`

Adjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:

```diff
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

  ...

  <application ...>

+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->
    <activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
+     android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
      ...
    >
      ...
    </activity>
  </application>

</manifest>
```

#### üõ† (<em>optional</em>) Customize `resizeMode`

The default image [`resizeMode`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#built-in-splash-screen-image-resize-modes) is [`CONTAIN`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#contain-resize-mode). If you want to have different `resizeMode`, you need to override in `res/values/strings.xml`.

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">contain|cover|native</string>
</resources>
```

#### üõ† (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode

##### Provide different background colors - `res/values-night/colors.png`

If you want to have different background colors in your splash screen depending on the system color mode, you need to create a similar file to `colors.xml`, but in the directory `res/values-night`.
Values in this file are going to picked by the system when it is switched to `dark` mode.

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
</resources>
```

##### Provide different splash screen image - `res/drawable-night/splashscreen_image.png`

You might want to provide a separate splash screen image for dark mode usage, and place it under the `res/drawable-night` directory with exactly the same name as the normal one.
This step is optional, because you might want to have the same image in both `light` and `dark` modes (e.g. you have just a light-themed logo and you want to have different background colors in different modes).

#### üõ† (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar

You might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.

1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag

To have the StatusBar completely hidden you need to update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry (to prevent StatusBar from hiding either remove this entry or enter `false` as the value):

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:windowFullscreen">true</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:windowFullscreen` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowFullscreen).

2. Customize `StatusBar style` option

This option is only available for Android devices running Android 6.0 or greater.
To enforce `light` or `dark` StatusBar style for given system color mode, you have to prepare or update your `res/values-v23/styles.xml` file with the following entry (as of this option being supported since API 23, you have to configure specifically named directory containing separate configuration files):

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:windowLightStatusBar">true|false</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

Available values:

- `true` for having dark-colored icons,
- `false` for having light-colored icons.

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night-v23` (for dark color mode), etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:windowLightStatusBar` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowLightStatusBar).

To read more about Android multi-API-level support see [this official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).

3. Customize `StatusBar color` option (a.k.a. `background color` of the StatusBar component)

To achieve custom background color you need to create a new color resource and provide it to the SplashScreen `style` description.

Create new color resource in your `res/values/colors.xml` (if your application supports dark mode, consider adding different color in `res/values-night/colors.xml` file):

```diff
  <resources>
    <!-- Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually -->
    <color name="splashscreen_background">#D0D0C0</color>
+   <color name="splashscreen_statusbar_color">#(AA)RRGGBB</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  </resources>
```

Update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry:

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:statusBarColor">@color/splashscreen_statusbar_color</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:statusBarColor` option in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#statusBarColor).

4. Customize `StatusBar translucent` flag

When the StatusBar is translucent, the app will be able to draw under the StatusBar component area.

To make the StatusBar translucent update your `res/values/strings.xml` file with the following content:

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent">true</string>
</resources>
```

## ‚ùì Known issues

### iOS caching

Splash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.

### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit

See [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.

> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Migrate from old versions

### Migrate from expo-splash-screen < 0.12.0

We try to keep changes backward compatible, the code for `expo-splash-screen` will still work as it used to be. However, if you are going to migrate as new style API, here are the steps:

1. Migrate your project from react-native-unimodules to expo-modules-core
2. Remove expo-splash-screen code from MainActivity

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java
+++ b/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java
 import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
 import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;

-import expo.modules.splashscreen.singletons.SplashScreen;
-import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;
-
 public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     // This is required for expo-splash-screen.
     setTheme(R.style.AppTheme);
     super.onCreate(null);
-    // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)
-    // Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually
-    SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class, false);
   }
```

3. Override default `resizeMode` and `statusBarTranslucent` in stings.xml

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">contain</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent">false</string>
</resources>
```

## üèÖ Hall Of Fame

This module is based on a solid work from (many thanks for that üëè):

- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen)
- [react-native-bootsplash](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash)
- [react-native-make](https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-make)

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - expo-status-bar@1.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# expo-status-bar

Provides the same interface as the React Native [StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar), but with slightly different defaults to work great in Expo environments.

- Default to `translucent={true}` on Android.
- The `style="auto"` maps to a dark status bar when in light mode and a light status bar when in dark moded. `style="inverted"` inverts this behavior.

# API documentation

- [Documentation for the master branch](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/docs/pages/versions/unversioned/sdk/status-bar.md)
- [Documentation for the latest stable release](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/status-bar/)

# Installation in managed Expo projects

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/image/). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

Please refer to the [React Native StatusBar API documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).

# Installation in bare React Native projects

```
npm install expo-status-bar
```

### Configure for iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package.

### Configure for Android

No additional setup necessary.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - fb-watchman@2.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# fb-watchman

`fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from
Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very
efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and
filesystem tree querying operations using
[a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).

## Install

You should [install Watchman](
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this
module.

Then simply:

```
$ npm install fb-watchman
```

## Key Concepts

- Watchman recursively watches directories.
- Each watched directory is called a `root`.
- You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes
- Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)
- change notifications are relative to the project root

## How do I use it?

[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - flow-parser@0.121.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# The flow-parser package

This package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.

# What is Flow

See [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).

# What is the Flow Parser

The Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.

# Usage

You can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do

```JavaScript
require('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});
```

To use in the browser, you can add

```HTML
<script src="flow_parser.js"></script>
```

which will make the `flow` object available to use like so:

```JavaScript
flow.parse('1+1', {});
```

## Options

The second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:

* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums
* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators
* `esproposal_class_instance_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class instance fields
* `esproposal_class_static_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class static fields
* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax
* `esproposal_optional_chaining` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of optional chaining (`?.`)
* `esproposal_nullish_coalescing` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of nullish coalescing (`??`)
* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. √Ç¬ß 101 et
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

jsonify
=======

This module provides Douglas Crockford's JSON implementation without modifying
any globals.

`stringify` and `parse` are merely exported without respect to whether or not a
global `JSON` object exists.

methods
=======

var json = require('jsonify');

json.parse(source, reviver)
---------------------------

Return a new javascript object from a parse of the `source` string.

If a `reviver` function is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value
pair to `reviver.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before
parsing it.

json.stringify(value, replacer, space)
--------------------------------------

Return a string representation for `value`.

If `replacer` is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value pair to
`replacer.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before stringifying
it.

If `space` is a number, indent the result by that many spaces.
If `space` is a string, use `space` as the indentation.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - lilconfig@2.0.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Lilconfig ‚öôÔ∏è
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lilconfig.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/lilconfig)
[![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=lilconfig)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=lilconfig)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/antonk52/lilconfig/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/antonk52/lilconfig)

A zero-dependency alternative to [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig) with the same API.

## Installation

```sh
npm install lilconfig
```

## Usage

```js
import {lilconfig, lilconfigSync} from 'lilconfig';

// all keys are optional
const options = {
    stopDir: '/Users/you/some/dir',
    searchPlaces: ['package.json', 'myapp.conf.js'],
    ignoreEmptySearchPlaces: false
}

lilconfig(
    'myapp',
    options // optional
).search() // Promise<LilconfigResult>

lilconfigSync(
    'myapp',
    options // optional
).load(pathToConfig) // LilconfigResult

/**
 * LilconfigResult
 * {
 *   config: any; // your config
 *   filepath: string;
 * }
 */
```

## Difference to `cosmiconfig`
Lilconfig does not intend to be 100% compatible with `cosmiconfig` but tries to mimic it where possible. The key differences are:
- **no** support for yaml files out of the box(`lilconfig` attempts to parse files with no extension as JSON instead of YAML). You can still add the support for YAML files by providing a loader, see an [example](#loaders-example) below.
- **no** cache

### Options difference between the two.

|cosmiconfig option      | lilconfig |
|------------------------|-----------|
|cache                   | ‚ùå        |
|loaders                 | ‚úÖ        |
|ignoreEmptySearchPlaces | ‚úÖ        |
|packageProp             | ‚úÖ        |
|searchPlaces            | ‚úÖ        |
|stopDir                 | ‚úÖ        |
|transform               | ‚úÖ        |

## Loaders example

If you need the YAML support you can provide your own loader

```js
import {lilconig} from 'lilconfig';
import yaml from 'yaml';

function loadYaml(filepath, content) {
    return yaml.parse(content);
}

const options = {
    loaders: {
        '.yaml': loadYaml,
        '.yml': loadYaml,
        // loader for files with no extension
        noExt: loadYaml
    }
};

lilconfig('myapp', options)
    .search()
    .then(result => {
        result // {config, filepath}
    });
```

## Version correlation

- lilconig v1 ‚Üí cosmiconfig v6
- lilconig v2 ‚Üí cosmiconfig v7

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# SYNOPSIS 
[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/merkle-patricia-tree.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/merkle-patricia-tree)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree.svg?style=flat-square)](https://coveralls.io/r/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree)
[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/ethereum/ethereumjs-lib.svg?style=flat-square)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/ethereumjs-lib) or #ethereumjs on freenode  

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)  

This is an implementation of the modified merkle patricia tree as specified in the [Ethereum's yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf).

> The modified Merkle Patricia tree (trie) provides a persistent data structure to map between arbitrary-length binary data (byte arrays). It is defined in terms of a mutable data structure to map between 256-bit binary fragments and arbitrary-length binary data. The core of the trie, and its sole requirement in terms of the protocol specification is to provide a single 32-byte value that identifies a given set of key-value pairs.   
  \- Ethereum's yellow paper  

The only backing store supported is LevelDB through the ```levelup``` module.

# INSTALL
 `npm install merkle-patricia-tree`

# USAGE

## Initialization and Basic Usage

```javascript
var Trie = require('merkle-patricia-tree'),
levelup = require('levelup'),
db = levelup('./testdb'),
trie = new Trie(db); 

trie.put('test', 'one', function () {
  trie.get('test', function (err, value) {
    if(value) console.log(value.toString())
  });
});
```

## Merkle Proofs

```javascript
Trie.prove(trie, 'test', function (err, prove) {
  if (err) return cb(err)
  Trie.verifyProof(trie.root, 'test', prove, function (err, value) {
    if (err) return cb(err)
    console.log(value.toString())
    cb()
  })
})
```

## Read stream on Geth DB

```javascript
var levelup = require('levelup')
var Trie = require('./secure')

var stateRoot = "0xd7f8974fb5ac78d9ac099b9ad5018bedc2ce0a72dad1827a1709da30580f0544" // Block #222

var db = levelup('YOUR_PATH_TO_THE_GETH_CHAIN_DB')
var trie = new Trie(db, stateRoot)

trie.createReadStream()
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log(data)
  })
  .on('end', function() { 
    console.log('End.')
  })
```

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Metro Hermes Compiler

This experimental module provides a high-level API to work with the Hermes bytecode compiler (HBC). HBC is integrated as a WASM binary generated by the emscripten toolchain and checked in as part of this package.

## How to build HBC

A pre-configured emscripten environment can be used through this [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/trzeci/emscripten/). Docker can be installed via its [desktop app](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/). Make sure to increase resource limits (16G RAM, as much CPU as possible).

```
cd path/to/hermes/checkout
docker run -i -t --rm -v `pwd`:`pwd` trzeci/emscripten bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y icu-devtools
cd path/to/hermes/checkout
cmake . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/emsdk_portable/emscripten/sdk/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j emhermesc
```

After the build process finishes the Hermes Bytecode Compiler JavaScript file will be available in the `bin` folder.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - metro-react-native-babel-preset@0.64.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# metro-react-native-babel-preset

Babel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.

If you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.

## Usage

As mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.

### Installation

Install `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:

with `npm`:

```sh
npm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev
```

or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset
```

### Configuring Babel

Then, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:

```
{
  "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"]
}
```

You can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.

## Help and Support

If you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Preconditions for Node.js
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/MathieuTurcotte/node-precond.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MathieuTurcotte/node-precond)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/precond.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/precond)

Precondition checks for Node.js inspired by [Guava's precondition checking
utilities](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/PreconditionsExplained).

## Installation

```
npm install precond
```

## Unit tests

```
npm test
```

## Overview

Precond provides a set of functions to verify arguments and state correctness

It lets you rewrite constructs like the following

```js
if (!this.isConnected) {
    throw new Error('Client should be connected before calling X.');
}
```

into a more compact and declarative check bellow.

```js
precond.checkState(this.isConnected, 'Client should be ...');
```

**Note that even though the throw statement is wrapped in a function, the call
stack will still start from the calling function. So the previous examples would
both produce the same stack trace.**

All arguments after the message will be used to format the actual error
message that will be thrown.

The following precondition checks are provded:

- checkArgument(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])
- checkState(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])
- checkIsDef(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsDefAndNotNull(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsString(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsArray(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsNumber(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsBoolean(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsFunction(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value
- checkIsObject(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value

## API

### Static functions

#### precond.checkArgument(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be truthy
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is true. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if value
is false.

#### precond.checkState(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be truthy
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is true. Throws an `IllegalStateError` if value
is false.

#### precond.checkIsDef(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be defined
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is defined (could be null). Throws an
`IllegalArgumentError` if value is undefined. Returns the value of
the value that was validated.

#### precond.checkIsDefAndNotNull(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be defined and not null
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is defined and not null. Throws an
`IllegalArgumentError` if value is undefined or null. Returns the value of
the value that was validated.

#### precond.checkIsString(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be a string
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is a string or a String object. Throws an
`IllegalArgumentError` if value isn't a string. Returns the value of
the value that was validated.

#### precond.checkIsArray(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be an array
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is an array. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if
value isn't an array. Returns the value of the value that was
validated.

#### precond.checkIsNumber(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be a number
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is a number. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if
value isn't a number. Returns the value of the value that was
validated.

#### precond.checkIsBoolean(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be a boolean
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is a boolean. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if
value isn't a boolean. Returns the value of the value that was
validated.

#### precond.checkIsFunction(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be a function
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is a function. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if
value isn't a function. Returns the value of the value that was
validated.

#### precond.checkIsObject(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])

- value: the value that is required to be an object
- messageFormat: error message format template
- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template

Ensures that value is an object. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if
value isn't an object. Returns the value of the value that was
validated.

### Class precond.IllegalArgumentError

Extends `Error` and is thrown to signal illegal arguments.

### Class precond.IllegalStateError

Extends `Error` and is thrown to signal that the program or object has reached
an illegal state.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - react-devtools-core@4.23.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `react-devtools-core`

A standalone React DevTools implementation.

This is a low-level package. If you're looking for the Electron app you can run, **use `react-devtools` package instead.**

## API

### `react-devtools-core`

This is similar requiring the `react-devtools` package, but provides several configurable options. Unlike `react-devtools`, requiring `react-devtools-core` doesn't connect immediately but instead exports a function:

```js
const { connectToDevTools } = require("react-devtools-core");
connectToDevTools(config);
```

Run `connectToDevTools()` in the same context as React to set up a connection to DevTools.  
Be sure to run this function *before* importing e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`.

The `config` object may contain:
* `host: string` (defaults to "localhost") - Websocket will connect to this host.
* `port: number` (defaults to `8097`) - Websocket will connect to this port.
* `useHttps: boolean` (defaults to `false`) - Websocket should use a secure protocol (wss).
* `websocket: Websocket` - Custom websocket to use. Overrides `host` and `port` settings if provided.
* `resolveRNStyle: (style: number) => ?Object` - Used by the React Native style plug-in.
* `retryConnectionDelay: number` (defaults to `2000`) - Milliseconds delay to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection.
* `isAppActive: () => boolean` - If provided, DevTools will poll this method and wait until it returns true before connecting to React.

## `react-devtools-core/standalone`

Renders the DevTools interface into a DOM node.

```js
require("react-devtools-core/standalone")
  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"))
  .setStatusListener(status => {
    // This callback is optional...
  })
  .startServer(port);
```

Renders DevTools interface into a DOM node over SSL using a custom host name (Default is localhost).

```js
const host = 'dev.server.com';
const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
};


require("react-devtools-core/standalone")
  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"))
  .setStatusListener(status => {
    // This callback is optional...
  })
  .startServer(port, host, options);
```

Reference the `react-devtools` package for a complete integration example.

## Development

Watch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:backend
```

Watch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:standalone
```

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - safe-event-emitter@1.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# safe-event-emitter

An `EventEmitter` that isolates the emitter from errors in handlers. If an error is thrown in a handler it is caught and re-thrown inside of a `setTimeout` so as to not interupt the emitter's code flow.

API is the same as `EventEmitter`.

### usage

```js
const SafeEventEmitter = require('safe-event-emitter')

const ee = new SafeEventEmitter()
ee.on('boom', () => { throw new Error() })
ee.emit('boom') // no error here

// error is thrown after setTimeout
```

This package contains the following license and notice below:

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)

sane
----

I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.
Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:

* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive
* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues
* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms
* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:
  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)
  * polling

## Install

```
$ npm install sane
```

## How to choose a mode

Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane
maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.

* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode
* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode
* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`
* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling
* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you

## API

### sane(dir, options)

Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.

```js
var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});
watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });
watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });
watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });
watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });
// close
watcher.close();
```

options:

* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.
* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.
* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).
* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.
* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).
* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.
* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.

For the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).
If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).
If you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).
For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).

### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)

The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)

The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)

The watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)

The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:

* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)

### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close

Stops watching.

### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events

Emits the following events:

All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory
* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory
* `change` when a file changes
* `add` when a file or directory has been added
* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted

## CLI

This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.

```
Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]

OPTIONS:
    --glob=<filePattern>
      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.

    --ignored=<filePattern>
      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.

    --poll, -p
      Use polling mode.

    --watchman, -w
      Use watchman (if available).

    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>
      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).

    --dot, -d
      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.

    --wait=<seconds>
      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled
      after running <command>. Setting this option will
      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.
    --quiet, -q
      Disables sane's console output

    --changes-only, -o
      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup
```

It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.

### CLI example usage
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --wait=3`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' -p`

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - stream-buffers@2.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Node Stream Buffers

[![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url]
[![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url]
[![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]

Simple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.

## Installation

[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]

## Usage

To use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.

```js
var streamBuffers = require("stream-buffers");
```

### Writable StreamBuffer

Writable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.

```js
var myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({
	initialSize: (100 * 1024),		// start as 100 kilobytes.
	incrementAmount: (10 * 1024)	// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.
});
```

The default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:

```js
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE 		// (8 * 1024)
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT	// (8 * 1024)
```

Writing is standard Stream stuff:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);
// - or -
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("\u00bd + \u00bc = \u00be", "utf8");
```

You can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: 

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF");
streamBuffers.size();			// 4.
streamBuffers.maxSize();		// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).
```

Retrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();					// Gets all held data as a Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8");		// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);					// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8", 5);	// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.
```

Care should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).
 
Destroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF");
myWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();

myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();		// Returns ASDF in Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("Yeah?");		// No effect.
```	

### Readable StreamBuffer

Readable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. 

The frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.

```js
var myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({
	frequency: 10,		// in milliseconds.
	chunkSize: 2048		// in bytes.
});
```

Default frequency and chunk size:

```js
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE 		// (1024)
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY			// (1)
```

Putting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);
myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String", "utf8");
```

Chunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: 

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) {
	// Yup.
	assert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);
});
```

Chunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. 

setEncoding() for streams is respected too:

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding("utf8");
myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) {
	assert.isTrue(data instanceof String);
});
```

Pause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. 

Destroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. 

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();
myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String!");
myReadableStreamBuffer.size();			// will be 0.
```

## Disclaimer

Not supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera.
  Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the
  `disableHixie` option to true.)
* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)
* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`)

### Installing

```
npm install --save ws
```

### Opt-in for performance

There are 2 optional modules that can be installed along side with the `ws`
module. These modules are binary addons which improve certain operations, but as
they are binary addons they require compilation which can fail if no c++
compiler is installed on the host system.

- `npm install --save bufferutil`: Improves internal buffer operations which
  allows for faster processing of masked WebSocket frames and general buffer
  operations.
- `npm install --save utf-8-validate`: The specification requires validation of
  invalid UTF-8 chars, some of these validations could not be done in JavaScript
  hence the need for a binary addon. In most cases you will already be
  validating the input that you receive for security purposes leading to double
  validation. But if you want to be 100% spec-conforming and have fast
  validation of UTF-8 then this module is a must.

### Sending and receiving text data

```js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');

ws.on('open', function open() {
  ws.send('something');
});

ws.on('message', function(data, flags) {
  // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received.
  // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked.
});
```

### Sending binary data

```js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');

ws.on('open', function open() {
  var array = new Float32Array(5);

  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
    array[i] = i / 2;
  }

  ws.send(array, { binary: true, mask: true });
});
```

Setting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be
masked according to the WebSocket protocol. The same option applies for text
data.

### Server example

```js
var WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server
  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
    console.log('received: %s', message);
  });

  ws.send('something');
});
```

### ExpressJS example

```js
var server = require('http').createServer()
  , url = require('url')
  , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server
  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: server })
  , express = require('express')
  , app = express()
  , port = 4080;

app.use(function (req, res) {
  res.send({ msg: "hello" });
});

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  var location = url.parse(ws.upgradeReq.url, true);
  // you might use location.query.access_token to authenticate or share sessions
  // or ws.upgradeReq.headers.cookie (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/16395220/151312)

  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
    console.log('received: %s', message);
  });

  ws.send('something');
});

server.on('request', app);
server.listen(port, function () { console.log('Listening on ' + server.address().port) });
```

### Server sending broadcast data

```js
var WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server
  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.broadcast = function broadcast(data) {
  wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {
    client.send(data);
  });
};
```

### Error handling best practices

```js
// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted
ws.send('something');

// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional
// callback. The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has
// actually been sent.
ws.send('something', function ack(error) {
  // if error is not defined, the send has been completed,
  // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.
});

// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note** that
// since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not* be
// captured when this technique is used.
try { ws.send('something'); }
catch (e) { /* handle error */ }
```

### echo.websocket.org demo

```js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {
  protocolVersion: 8,
  origin: 'http://websocket.org'
});

ws.on('open', function open() {
  console.log('connected');
  ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});
});

ws.on('close', function close() {
  console.log('disconnected');
});

ws.on('message', function message(data, flags) {
  console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);

  setTimeout(function timeout() {
    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});
  }, 500);
});
```

### Other examples

For a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the
examples folder.

Note that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express
2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.

Otherwise, see the test cases.

### Running the tests

```
make test
```
